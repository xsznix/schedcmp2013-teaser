			<p>The concept Schedule Comparinator was born on the fifteenth of August, 2011. It started with a simple observation: the scrambling of students onto Facebook to see who would be in their classes the coming school year. From there, the two original developers, Yash and Simon, set out to rapidly create something to simply this chaotic workflow.</p>
			<p>The first version was nothing remarkable in terms of functionality or design. In the span of two days, the two developers set out to create their first small scale multi-user web application, a tiny four-page PHP site. Almost three hundred excited Westwood students joined in.</p>
			<p>But even this simple application had profound effects. It set a precedent: every year, there would be a new and better Schedule Comparinator. It would do one simple job, but it was to do it well. The brand name had already been thrown out into the wild, and hopefully, it would grow.</p>
			<p>The next summer, Yash and Simon got together with Justin to create Schedule Comparinator 2012, a more complete and polished version of the original. The goal was to make something that looked like a website and not a two-day hack. And when schedules started being released, it was all ready to go. And as an added bonus, it was available for all RRISD high schools, not just Westwood.</p>
			<p>The resulting user base reached almost a thousand users, enough to warrant a database upgrade on Heroku, the web hosting service that serves Schedule Comparinator. But there was still more left to be done.</p>
			<p>In the Schedule Comparinator 2012 survey, the team saw a few recurring complaints. The most common was against Facebook integration, forcing users to link their Facebook accounts or create one if they didn't have one. And there was still much to be done in terms of site design. New functionality could be added to provide a more complete experience. All of these things justify some major overhauls in the next version.</p>
			<p>Schedule Comparinator 2013 contains a complete renewal of the visual design and several key features, including some by request. Users won't be forced to use their Facebook accounts, and individual user profiles can be searched via an opt-in feature. (You can read more about these on the landing page.)</p>
			<p>In addition, it is also being developed by a larger, more diverse team of students. Since Yash graduated in May 2013, there has been a pressing issue: who will keep the site running after the original founders have left? By encouraging more people to participate in the Schedule Comparinator effort, we hope that it will continue to be an honored tradition that represents the motivated spirits of ambitious young programmers.</p>
